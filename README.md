## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chukwuka Madueke

Iâ€™m a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.
I am skilled in Python, C++, and Unity and am currently seeking new grad opportunities where I can begin work after graduating in May 2024.
I have a particular interest in the emerging XR, brain-computer interface, and artificial intelligence industries.
