## 👋 Hi, I’m Sydney Madueke

I’m a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.
I am skilled in Mechatronics, Python, and C++ and am currently seeking new grad opportunities where I can begin work after graduating in May 2024.

I have a particular interest in the robotics, emerging XR, brain-computer interface, and artificial intelligence industries.
